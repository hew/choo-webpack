# Choo Webpack
>  A lightweight boilerplate for Choo && Webpack

### Demo

http://hew.github.io/choo-webpack

### What's Included
* [Choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo)
* [Sprint](https://github.com/yoshu://github.com/bendc/sprint)
* [Csjs](https://github.com/rtsao/csjs)
* [Animateplus](https://github.com/bendc/animateplus)
* [On-load](https://github.com/shama/on-load)

### Why Webpack?
You may have noticed that @yoshuawuyts has created the Choo ecosystem using Browserify, but I've been using Webpack for a while and I don't really feel like switching back to Browserify. 

### About the CSS
I thought I would try a css-in-js approach. Currently, the CSS is inserted into the head of the document. In future versions, I'll probably move that to an external stylesheet. 

### Production? Uh, No.
I mostly built this for fun, and maybe to prototype with. It's not a boilerplate that will serve production needs very well, if at all.
